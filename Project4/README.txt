ALGORITHMS IMPLEMENTED:
1- Random Page Selection
2- FIFO Page Selection: Using counter to keep track of when a page was inserted into the Page Table
3- Least Recently Used Page Selection Algorithm: Keeps track of when a page was last created, accessed or written to and considers those recently used. We evict pages that are LEAST recently used by keeping track of Epoch time.
