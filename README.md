# CS3013 - Operating Systems
I worked on 4 projects over the course of "Operating Systems" (CS3013) at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I have attached the source to all four of the projects in this GitHub repository.

Here is a quick description of the projects:
- **[Linux Shell](https://github.com/akshitsoota/WPI-CS3013-OperatingSystems/tree/master/Project1)**: In this class project, we were to  implement a shell in multiple phases, with each phase building upon the prior one. This allowed us to learn about process creation, termination, and resource usage in the Linux operating system.
- **[Kernel Interception](https://github.com/akshitsoota/WPI-CS3013-OperatingSystems/tree/master/Project2)**: In this class project, we were to perform two types of system call interceptions with the help of Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs): a straightforward monitoring approach and a more creative reinterpretation of an existing system call.
- **[Synchronization Problem](https://github.com/akshitsoota/WPI-CS3013-OperatingSystems/tree/master/Project3)**: The goal of this class project was to understand race conditions, global/shared data structures and how to use semaphores, mutexes and mutex locks.
- **[Implementing Virtual Memory](https://github.com/akshitsoota/WPI-CS3013-OperatingSystems/tree/master/Project4)**: The goal of this class project was to create a page table and manage the allocation of pages in virtual setting.
